# Supply-Chain-Demand-Forecasting-and-Data-Management

Demand forecasting enables companies to make significant changes to how they market, price, and plan the sale of their products. Imagine if a consumer products company - selling edible products through grocery stores - chronically put 10% more on the shelves than it sold, a buffer that ocercompensated for the risk of running out of stock. Over time, this would add up to an expensive miscalculation.

Such a forecast, when combined with an analysis of consumer, cost, and competition, would enable the company to make accurate pricing decisions. Add-in logistical and storage data, and they could assess future capacity requirements, ensure availability, and adapt vendor/distribution logistics to realize customer satisfaction.

## Common solutions for demand forcasting:

1. Traditional commercial software/platform: SPSS,SAS,JMP
2. Commercial machine learning platform: accelerating data analysis with high level of automated machine learning, Google Cloud AutoML, Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, etc.
3. Build in-house solution from scratch

## Project Introduction:

In this project, we need to use historical data and external signals to develop a model to help a pharmacy store chain with the future demand on different nutrition related products. The model should provide a forecast for Summer 2016 at the SKU-quarter-Global level.

## Datasets:

1. Historical_sales2.csv: is the weekly historicak sales data for each product. The file contains the historical sales data of products at a weekly level form Spring 2014 to Spring 2016.
2. Products2.csv: contains the product information, sku is the unique ID.
3. Predicted_list2.csv: has the products that need demand forecasting at quarterly level. This list contains the 407 distinck products (unique ID is SKU) that need demand forcasting for quarter SU2016 (Summer 2016). It's a mix of carry-over product from previous years and newly launched products.

## Recommendation:

1. Fill up the last section 'prediction'.
2. Think of any alternative approaches.
3. If you are the data scientist/analyst in this team, how would you present your result to the business person? Any recommendations? Any further actions?
